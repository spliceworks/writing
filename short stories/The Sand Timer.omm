I was once at the bottom of a well and it was on day 464 that i decided to climb out. I mean, it wasn’t like i hadn’t wanted to get out before this day, but now i’d decided to do it rather than just want to do it.  something somehow solidified in reality as if it were irradiated by a strong ray from the sun, the way out.
the bottom of the well had long since dried up and the earthy walls showed no sign of dampness. their smell held the past occupation with a grapeskin mustiness that only grew stronger once the partially dry surface layer was scraped away. once exposed it’s ruddy brown core, had the consistancy of crank clay, with small stones and shards of sharp sand distributed homogeneously throughout it. occasionally on digging one would find a pea sized piece of soft stone that would crumble under the pressure of a thumb and finger.one did rarely find within the muddy substrate small pieces of a much harder metamorphic rock. I was lucky to find one of these about the size of an almond and with it begin digging my way out of the hole.  the first few days of being in the well seem now to have dissolved into the sistsanf paast and emulsified with memories, only the scratchs on the muddy walls of tie thoes days past with the present. i remember being preoccupied with escape, and of spending countless hours scratching the walls with my hands and crying up and out to the stars. i rememner the bbeautiful teracotta of the brown mud as it mixed with my blood. i remember the pain that came with the beauty. i remember the exposed bone that started to protrude from my fingertipsas i ignored the pain and pushed on in a waterfall of pain. most clearly of all however is that i remember stopping. I remember the defeat of it all.  I sat motionless for several days. i didnt scream, i didnt cry, i didnt ask anything. the emotions were there, but their connection to me, there vessle to the outside world had been severed, torn apart by mental anguish. as i sat, i took in my position, usually one can sumise and rationalise the situation that they find themselves in; i am on a bus, i am having a bath, i am in a cafe eating a cake. it took three days for me to be able to start feeling again. it came slowly at first, my skin started to feel cold. the wind on my face, barely noticable, let me know that i was still alive. i lost count of the days that were required to fully regain conciousness, of the days rationalising my existance to myself, creating lies to ensure the actuality of the situation didnt break me. i was grey and emty, hope had departed, and it was then that i began questioning who i was. what horrendous person had put me in this well? why me? what malign force had decided that i deserved this punishment. i became enraged and besat my bleeding hands against the walls of the well. soft impressions were left in the mud amongst the previous scratches. i continued to pound the same spot deeper and deeper into the wall. i struck the wall so hard that the blunt force split my skin. i brought the foot of my hand up to my mouth to suck the wound clean, there was a glassy grit stuck into my flesh. 
i stared marvelously at the wall where i had vented overboard my anger and out of it protruding not more than a three milimeters was a sharp glassy point, the point i realise now was the cause of my punctured hand. i started to pick at it with my two working fingers, the two that weren’t currently worn away. after some considerable time and effor the small white and smoke filled stone popped out of it’s muddy socket and landed glittering on the floor of the well. in that stone i felt the universe condense, colapsing into it. all my future hopes, all the dreams of things yet to come, all the people and places that i was yet to see, all the untold stories and all my past memories, they all crystalised inside that little seed. i lived on the happiness that teh find gave me for long enough for my hands to heal and during that time i plotted my escape. once the scars were gone i began to use the sharp stone to dig, it was slow progress as i held it between index middle and thumb, and as a woodpecker uses it’s beak, i began to slowly peck away at the mud taht surrounded me. after what i think was a week i had a tunnel long enough to lie my whole body in. It was at this distance that  the mud changed consistancy. it’s smooth claylike natures gave way to something a lot harder,which resulted in much slower progress. after another week of this reduced rate cutting, i had only progresesed another arms length. this harder going proved to be only a minor set back as after another week of digging annd with my almond stone which was worn down to a stump i reached softer ground once again. in this more plyable material is was able to cut in a day what preciously took a week and as time proressed, even though my stone was almost gone i covered more and more ground. the material was fantastically sandy and by the second week after reaching the hard mud the tunnel was so long that i had taken to sleeping in it as to not have to backtrack on my hands and kneews at the end of each day. this progress went incredibly dmoothly and the soil which i cut and moved with my hanfs eas becoming drier and drier, a sign that i could only  attribulte to being closer to the surface.
	i was asleep when it happened, at first a deep rumbling woke me from my deep and peaceful slumber. then the sound of distant rain and finally dust. i didnt comprehend the magnitude of the problem that had just occured as i still struggled to breath in the c loying air. I crawled forwards to where I had heard the first rummbling. the loose ground which i had been shoveling most haphazardly had collapsed in front of me. the pain was unbearable, the mental pain that i suffered digging this tomb was nothing compared with the mental pain of loss, of the destruction of the future and the enevitable futility of any attempted escape. so much progress eradicated in a matter of seconds. the air was viscous with the glassy shards from the collapsed tunnel. i have to explain to you now that in my haste to make progress the tunnel wasnt wide enough to turn around it.  and was barely tall enough to crawl within. The dust was choking me out of the tunnel, i was being chased on my hands and kneews crawlig backwards as fast as i could, when my feet struck something, solid  but forgiving. it was only wheni noticed the metalic taste of freshliy fallen earth that i turely realised my fate.
