I was once at the bottom of a well and it was on day 464 that i decided to climb out. I mean, it wasn’t like i hadn’t wanted to get out before this day, but now i’d decided to do it rather than just want to do it.  something somehow solidified in reality as if it were irradiated by a strong ray from the sun, the way out.
the bottom of the well had long since dried up and the earthy walls showed no sign of dampness. their smell held the past occupation with a grapeskin mustiness that only grew stronger once the partially dry surface layer was scraped away. once exposed it’s ruddy brown core, had the consistancy of crank clay, with small stones and shards of sharp sand distributed homogeneously throughout it. occasionally on digging one would find a pea sized piece of soft stone that would crumble under the pressure of a thumb and finger.one did rarely find within the muddy substrate small pieces of a much harder metamorphic rock. I was lucky to find one of these about the size of an almond and with it begin digging my way out of the hole.  the first few days of being in the well seem now to have dissolved into the sistsanf paast and emulsified with memories, only the scratchs on the muddy walls of tie thoes days past with the present. i remember being preoccupied with escape, and of spending countless hours scratching the walls with my hands and crying up and out to the stars. i rememner the bbeautiful teracotta of the brown mud as it mixed with my blood. i remember the pain that came with the beauty. i remember the exposed bone that started to protrude from my fingertipsas i ignored the pain and pushed on in a waterfall of pain. most clearly of all however is that i remember stopping. I remember the defeat of it all.  I sat motionless for several days. i didnt scream, i didnt cry, i didnt ask anything. the emotions were there, but their connection to me, there vessle to the outside world had been severed, torn apart by mental anguish. as i sat, i took in my position, usually one can sumise and rationalise the situation that they find themselves in; i am on a bus, i am having a bath, i am in a cafe eating a cake. it took three days for me to be able to start feeling again. it came slowly at first, my skin started to feel cold. the wind on my face, barely noticable, let me know that i was still alive. i lost count of the days that were required to fully regain conciousness, of the days rationalising my existance to myself, creating lies to ensure the actuality of the situation didnt break me. i was grey and emty, hope had departed, and it was then that i began questioning who i was. what horrendous person had put me in this well? why me? what malign force had decided that i deserved this punishment. i became enraged and besat my bleeding hands against the walls of the well. soft impressions were left in the mud amongst the previous scratches. i continued to pound the same spot deeper and deeper into the wall. i struck the wall so hard that the blunt force split my skin. i brought the foot of my hand up to my mouth to suck the wound clean, there was a glassy grit stuck into my flesh. 
i stared marvelously at the wall where i had vented overboard my anger and out of it protruding not more than a three milimeters was a sharp glassy point, the point i realise now was the cause of my punctured hand. i started to pick at it with my two working fingers, the two that weren’t currently worn away. after some considerable time and effor the small white and smoke filled stone popped out of it’s muddy socket and landed glittering on the floor of the well. in that stone i felt the universe condense, colapsing into it. all my future hopes, all the dreams of things yet to come, all the people and places that i was yet to see, all the untold stories and all my past memories, they all crystalised inside that little seed. i lived on the happiness that teh find gave me for long enough for my hands to heal and during that time i plotted my escape. once the scars were gone i began to use the sharp stone to dig, it was slow progress as i held it between index middle and thumb, and as a woodpecker uses it’s beak, i began to slowly peck away at the mud taht surrounded me. after what i think was a week i had a tunnel long enough to lie my whole body in. It was at this distance that  the mud changed consistancy. it’s smooth claylike natures gave way to something a lot harder,which resulted in much slower progress. after another week of this reduced rate cutting, i had only progresesed another arms length. this harder going proved to be only a minor set back as after another week of digging annd with my almond stone which was worn down to a stump i reached softer ground once again. in this more plyable material is was able to cut in a day what preciously took a week and as time proressed, even though my stone was almost gone i covered more and more ground. the material was fantastically sandy and by the second week after reaching the hard mud the tunnel was so long that i had taken to sleeping in it as to not have to backtrack on my hands and kneews at the end of each day. this progress went incredibly dmoothly and the soil which i cut and moved with my hanfs eas becoming drier and drier, a sign that i could only  attribulte to being closer to the surface.
	i was asleep when it happened, at first a deep rumbling woke me from my deep and peaceful slumber. then the sound of distant rain and finally dust. i didnt comprehend the magnitude of the problem that had just occured as i still struggled to breath in the c loying air. I crawled forwards to where I had heard the first rummbling. the loose ground which i had been shoveling most haphazardly had collapsed in front of me. the pain was unbearable, the mental pain that i suffered digging this tomb was nothing compared with the mental pain of loss, of the destruction of the future and the enevitable futility of any attempted escape. so much progress eradicated in a matter of seconds. the air was viscous with the glassy shards from the collapsed tunnel. i have to explain to you now that in my haste to make progress the tunnel wasnt wide enough to turn around it.  and was barely tall enough to crawl within. The dust was choking me out of the tunnel, i was being chased on my hands and kneews crawlig backwards as fast as i could, when my feet struck something, solid  but forgiving. it was only wheni noticed the metalic taste of freshliy fallen earth that i turely realised my fate. i had no way of knowing how much of what had once been my means of escape existed any longer, my escape route had become my tomb. buried alive by themself, such a tragic end to anyone. the panic continued to fill my brain, swelling and ebbing as the minutes progressed. the harrowing number of possible future realities seemed to compress me as time continued to strike decisions. the exact moment that the follwoing happened, i find very difficult to pinpoint exactly, howeverj i can remember both beforea dn afther the moment distinctly. as the inummerable grains of sand fall from the reservoir at the top of an hourglass into the pool at the bottom. i felt squeezed through the venturi, compressed and distorted until i was unrecongnisable to myself. all the familar textures of the tunnel bleniding into a fantasy taht i was stuck witin.  a boring pressure ruptured my spirit and drew out my breath. i was left, an emoty shell, tired and broken on the shores of pain.
this intense compression continued until i could no longer talk, no longer scream and my breaths were snaotched. my mind was being constricted by an otherworldly force. a force incomprihensible magnitude that i was only as a mote of dust is to the star that consumes it within it’s vast swirling bosom. i was left empty and hopeless, devoid of emotions. my mouth was dry, my lungs were drained and scarred from the fouled air. it was without warning that the tunnel which by this time i was convinced would be where i drew my last breath filled with colourfiul light neon yellows, greens, reds, pinks, uintil finally a soft sky electric blue iluminated the passage before me. this technicolour meltdown gradually faded and as it passed, i noticed taht i coulf breathe once again and that reality had seettled back to it’s uncomfortable level of normality. with this newly quickened air and knowing how close my existance had come to being extinguished i found a new vigour of problem solving in order to extricate myself from the perilous position that i found myself in. the analysis of the situation found me aproximately 100 meters from a tunnel fall in front of me and pressed up against another under my feet. given that i had been digging for the best part of a month by then, i  estimated taht i was no more than 50 mteres from the tunnels entrance and probably, due to the nature of the sandy soil more likely 35 meters. hope had somehow wandered back onto the track of my life and i began wondering how long it was going to be until we met face to face. with this excitement i started to shift the sandy earth from my feet along my side to beyond my head. it was as i shuffled the dirt as a worm does inside it’s self that my hands happend upon something unlike the stone peas that I had become accustomed to. it was almost warm to the touch and certainly not cold. it was much larger and longer than the other stones i had found and almost shovel shaped with a thinner middle section and a large bulbous end. i started to use this stone to move the earth around me , and with the help from this new tool, a much fasater pace was achieved. This wasnt the only stone of this shape that i uncovered while baacktracking through the collapsed section of the tunnel, in fact, i found 8 long stones, and many curved and a plethora of weirdly shaped ones. most extraordinary of these finds was a bowl shaped  stone that seemed to be the work of man than nature. it was with this woodlike bowl that i was able to scoop vast quantities of material out of my path incredibly quickly. i even used it to dig away the sides of the tunnel in order to create enough room to turn around in. i was now facing the well and moving at a great pace towards it now that i had an array of digging equipment with which to excavate. it felt like no time at all until i was once again back at the hard packed earth that first hampered my tunnelingn effort. luckily at this hard seam of rocky earth  the tunnel’s collapse had ended. the first thing i smelt was the outside air, that rushed lovingly into the tunnel behind me. it blew past my face and washed my mind of the past weeks of anguish. as i crawled forwards, almost crying from exhaustion the light of the outside seemed to creep towards me as I towards it. at first the brightness was bearable but as i progressed it stunnedd me, i felt almost repulsed by the light as it etched a trail through my eyes and into the depths of my skull. it was violating me, exposing within me all the things i had forgotten to hate. only the desire to be free of my earthly confines which had cuccooned me forced me from my hole. bringing all of my digging implements with me i crawled faster, until finally i was free and stood up once again. once my mind, body and most importantly eyes became adjusted to the light i took a deep breath and crained my head backwardsd. the same blue sky that had alweays been there beemen it’s liquid smile back at me. flowing confidence filled me as i realised the relief of being back in the open space of the well, it was the right place. only then as i looked down at my makeshift shovels that i realised what they were. although caked in mud and dust, their familar whiteness glistened under teh bright blue light above; they seemed old, but not infirm and they were most unmistakeably bones.

bones of a fallen comrade, somes of someone else like me who had been placed in this well. a man or woman? artist or slave? my mind seemed to liquify into an icy stream and flow most viscously down my spine. solidarity with this person whoever they were wrenched tears from my eyes and wrapped my heart in tight muslin. why were they not spared by the earth, why wasnt i consumed by it’s grip? why was it I, that was allowed to live. I sat wit the bones in my lap and the bowl shaped one at the top of the pile, the teeth jutting from the lower jaw made reality to be in sharper focus. the hopes and dreams that were once within that skull were now pulverised. the genetic linik into the past stretching for millions of years uninterupted now ended in a cold trail. i can’t remember how long i stayed in this position hunched over the remains of another soul, drained of energy and filled with a vicious anger that tore chunks of flesh from my psyche. i treasured the bones and ran their forms many times between my fingers, imagining the flesh that once sat around them. i whispered into the empty skull trying to fill the space once again with thuoghts and memories. darkness fell on me, a deathly blanket smothering me for what felt like an eternity but on day 64 i decided to climb out of the well. i started by first gathering up the bones and embedding them into the muddy clay ath the base of the well. i climbed up them like a rudimentary staircase and once i had run out of ribs and only had the two largest bones in my hands i was about three body lengths off the ground. i then used the two femus as an alpinist would a set of ice axes and jammed them into the soil above my head. i then pulled up on then and dug them in again. my own legs scrabbled uselessly agains the wall of the well during this process and at many times i thoughth of all the manifestations of catastrophe that could strike. after an hour, fatigue was consuming me but i was driven upwards  by the smell of fresher air and the sweetness of the sunshine which started washing over me at this new altitude. i could see the blue circle that filled my vision increase in size a large orb, a lushious planet floating in the blackish brown sky of the sides of the well. it swole as an autumn moon with every move upward i made until it filled the whole of my field of view, it was at this point that i knew i was close. sweat was beading on my brow and my muscles ached, their sinues working beyond normal plastic deformation and beginning to rupture under the prolonged strain. only a few more meters to go. one of the bones snapped and i was left hanging by one arm. too worn out to do anything, unable to hold on for much longer i was sure to fall to my death. as my fingers started to disengage from the bone i heard only faintly someone speaking to me. the skull whispering to me from the bottom of the well. “you are not alone, you are supported by those before you.” with this i reached up with my free hand stepped up on what felt like nothingness and grasped over the top lip of the well. the moment that my fingers made it over the top my body electrified and i gained the energy to pull myself over. after spending so much time with vertical surfaces it was an incredible relief to finally be interacting with something horizontal once again. my skin bristled with the radience of the golden sun that flowed raidience upon me, a caressing touch. rivulets of joy ran over my body in inscendiary happiness. my eyes welcomed the light which came this time without interogation, and for the first time in many years i felt free. i started to walk away from the hole that i had been trapped within, still wondering who it was that would do such a henious  thing to me. and as my eyes  finally began adjusting to the brightness i saw a large object twenty paces away washing in and out of focus between the glistening tears. as i aproached it, it’s form became more obvious and finally as i place my gnarled palm against it i realised that there was a soft interior curve to it’s muddy exterior. i threw my head back in desperation as i realised that i was at the bottom of a well.
