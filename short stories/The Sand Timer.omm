I was once at the bottom of a well and it was on day 464 that i decided to climb out. I mean, it wasn’t like i hadn’t wanted to get out before this day, but now i’d decided to do it rather than just want to do it.  something somehow solidified in reality as if it were irradiated by a strong ray from the sun, the way out.
the bottom of the well had long since dried up and the earthy walls showed no sign of dampness. their smell held the past occupation with a grapeskin mustiness that only grew stronger once the partially dry surface layer was scraped away. once exposed it’s ruddy brown core, had the consistancy of crank clay, with small stones and shards of sharp sand distributed homogeneously throughout it. occasionally on digging one would find a pea sized piece of soft stone that would crumble under the pressure of a thumb and finger.one did rarely find within the muddy substrate small pieces of a much harder metamorphic rock. I was lucky to find one of these about the size of an almost and with it begin digging my way out of the hole.
